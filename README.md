# Zakadabar Module Template

This repository contains module template which you may use to
start a new module project based on the [Zakadabar Stack](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/zakadabar-stack).

In this repository everything you should change when you create your own
module has "template" or "Template" in the name or content. Use search & replace
to make sure there is nothing left to change.
